# Image processing algorihtms for Placido disk images

The code from my contract works. This is not a complete system, but rather some working modules for image processing.

- Edge based image quality estimation
- Eye lash removal
- Subpixel edge detection

You will need Python 2.7, Numpy, Scipy and OpenCV to run the code
